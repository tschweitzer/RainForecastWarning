"""The pages' own assets and wiring.

Browser behaviour cannot be asserted here - geolocation needs a browser, and that was checked
against Chromium separately. What these tests hold in place is the wiring that made the old
button silently do nothing: the helper being served at all, every page actually loading it, and
each page having somewhere to put a message when the attempt fails.
